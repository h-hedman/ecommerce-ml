  - ### Predicting Customer Purchases Using Random Forests  
  - **Aim** - The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a customer makes a purchase on an e-commerce platform based on demographic and behavioral factors. Model outcomes are compared with LightGMB and XGBoost.
  - **Objectives** - (1) Identify key predictors of customer purchases, (2) assess the accuracy and performance of the model , and (3) Understand the impact of customer age, session duration, and promotion engagement on purchase decisions
  - **Hypothesis** - H‚ÇÄ: There is no significant relationship between customer features and purchasing behavior; H‚ÇÅ: Customer attributes (age, session duration, and promotion engagement) significantly influence purchases

  - **Aim** - ## This model predicts revenue conversion in e-commerce using synthetic data. It leverages features such as impressions, clicks, and past conversions with a logistic regression framework. 
  - **Objectives** - Develop and evaluate a predictive model that accurately forecasts revenue conversion, 
  - **Hypothesis** - H‚ÇÄ: Impressions, clicks, and past conversion history do not significantly influence revenue conversion.; H‚ÇÅ: Higher impressions, increased clicks, and positive past conversion history significantly boost the likelihood of revenue conversion
